For github we had to make a repository then we had 2 methods to upload the data :- Within browser(website), command line(normal, vs terminal, git bash)
Command:-

1. Make a repo and copy that url & clone the repo and start uploading data.
git clone repo-link

For initializing - 
git init(initialized git repo) all files will had "U" symbol => Untracked File

gitignore => It is used for ignoring the files in github.
dir = to see folders; cd = change directory.

1. git add . / git add * to upload all the files in github
git add foldername/filename (for particular folder/file)
if we add the files we will see "A" symbol. 
2. git commit -m "give some message". (after that "A" & "U" symbol will be removed).
3. git push.(pushing the folders local to github).
4. git status.(check the status).
5. git checkout.(changing the branch).

Error(while pushing) - 
remote: Permission to Dipesh77Dev/Web-Development-practice-tutorial1.git denied to DipeshDevrukhkar.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Dipesh77Dev/Web-Development-practice-tutorial1.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
